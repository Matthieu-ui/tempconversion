# tempconversion
A PHP application that converts temperatures based on user input.

The application must:

Convert at least 3 temperature types, for example Fahrenheit to Celcius, Celcius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Kelvin.
Disallow incorrect data and provide feedback, for example, when a user inputs a string, the data is not processed and the user is informed of the mistake.
Be built as nearly as possible to PSR-1 Links to an external site.and PSR-2 Links to an external site.standards
Project Document: Besides a working application, you must also show your program design pieces visually on a project document shared by your team.

Visual Elements Required: Your program design document should identify an IPO chart and a flowchart of how the application will operate and process data.

Source Code Required: Please show your source code by placing your code in a repo. Please also have the web application online on one of your servers, and have a link to the web app working online in your project document. Also provide a link to your repo, if you are using one, in the project document as well.  If you wish to use a private repo, you can use my GitHub username and share it with me: kyrrahnork

Work Log: Your project document must include notes from each team member at the bottom of the document identifying what was done, how long it took each and every time work is done on the project.  Here's an example notation:

4/26/2016: (Bill) Updated P1 Temperature Conversion assignment to include updated requirements.  (.5 hours)

Each member should place the most recent work at the top, so that each work log entry descends in chronological order.

Hint: As a basis for the application, I would start with a postback application, such as can be found in the lesson, POST & GET with Forms. I always find it easier to start with a working app, and re-tool it rather than starting from scratch!

Be Responsive To Your Team: Be sure you work together as a team on this!  Stay in communication and work as a group.

Roles & Responsibilities

Consider splitting up the responsibilities so everyone is productive.

Roles: Be sure the work to be done is split up as evenly as possible, with each member taking on multiple roles as required.  These roles could could fulfill duties such as:

Visual Design: build the HTML page mockups and partial repeating HTML fragments
Research: Research equations & techniques necessary.
Documentation: Making sure the code is documented properly and completely
Code Review: Check for standards compliance and consistent documentation
Repo Management: If you're branching code, someone should manage merges,  conflicts and issues
Testing: Testing the code to be sure it succeeds in many conditions, including upon input of bad data
Project Management: Making sure all items are completed on time, and no important pieces are missing
Application Design: Building the fundamental programmatic pages
Page/Data Architecture: Determine the  pages & data required for the app 
Early/Middle/Late Roles: The roles identified above can be distributed so work is done effectively at every stage of the project.  We'll define early/middle/late as the following:

Early: Before code has been written.  Research, visual design, experimentation, goal setting and algorithms can be the early focus
Middle: Everyone should be coding - hopefully in different areas of the app
Late: Developers can code review each other's work, and perform testing and documentation
Example Division of Work: Below we'll take a 3 person team and identify some roles designed to occupy each team member during early, late & middle stages of a project:

Member #1: Early - Visual Design, Project Management Late - Testing, Documentation
Member #2: Early - App Design Late - Project Management, Code Review
Member #3: Early - Research, Repo Management Late - Code Review, Repo Management
All members code in middle stage: The middle stage is not mentioned above as all team members would be coding at that stage.

Due date is midnight on group projects: To allow use of class time, all group projects have a soft due date, and the time on the submission is midnight.

Deliverable (submission): All members of the team MUST submit a shareable link to their team's Project Document to get credit for this assignment.

Extra Credit: You can gain up to 30 points extra credit for building an application that convert back and forth between all 3 types of temperatures, Fahrenheit, Celsius and Kelvin, back and forth (6 total conversions) and round the result to 2 decimal points!
